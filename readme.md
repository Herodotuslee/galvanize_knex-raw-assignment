# Knex Raw Assignment

For this assignment you'll need to create everything from scratch. Use the project we gave you in the previous lesson as a template if you get stuck!

You'll need to make a full RESTful CRUD api for the following table:
```
Table name - posts
Columns:
id,
content,
author,
upvotes
```

Make sure to really think about what type of data each column should contain!
